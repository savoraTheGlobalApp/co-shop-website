            Shopping is more fun and rewarding when you do it smartly—especially with friends! Here’s how to make the most of your Co-Shop experience and become a savvy shopper.
        </p>
        <h2>Top Tips for Smart Shopping</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Set a Budget:</strong> Decide how much you want to spend before you start browsing. Use Co-Shop’s wishlist to keep track of your must-haves.</li>
            <li><strong>Collaborate with Friends:</strong> Use group chats to get instant feedback, share finds, and even split purchases for group discounts.</li>
            <li><strong>Track Price Drops:</strong> Add items to your wishlist and get notified when prices go down or sales start.</li>
            <li><strong>Compare Before You Buy:</strong> Use Co-Shop’s comparison tools to make sure you’re getting the best deal.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Why Shop Collaboratively?</h2>
        <p>
            Collaborative shopping isn’t just about fun—it’s about making better choices. Friends can help you avoid impulse buys, discover new brands, and even share exclusive deals.
